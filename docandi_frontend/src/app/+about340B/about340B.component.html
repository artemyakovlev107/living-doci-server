                <h2>What is 340B</h2>
                <p>The 340B Drug Pricing Program plays a critical role in enabling hospitals, healthcare centers, clinics and other healthcare providers that serve a disproportionate share of low-income and vulnerable patients to fulfill their vital mission of providing care to all regardless of oneâ€™s ability to pay.</p>
                <p>Participation in the 340B program is a privilege granted by Congress. Hospitals and other providers use the program to stretch their scarce resources as far as possible, enabling them to reach more eligible patients and provide more comprehensive services.</p>
                <!--<p>Medications that were once hard to afford for uninsured patients become obtainable through discounts provided by the 340B Drug Pricing Program.</p>-->

                <h2>340B Lost Savings </h2>
                <p>
                    Nationally, 340B Qualified entities, such as Disproportionate Share Hospitals, Community Health Centers, Critical Access Hospitals, and Pediatric Hospitals capture <span class="red">only 5%</span> of potential savings available through the 340B program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of this lost opportunity arises from a lack of patient awareness and from a lack of awareness at the pharmacies that are contracted by the 340B Qualified entity.
